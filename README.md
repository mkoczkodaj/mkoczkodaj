### Hello world ğŸ˜„ ###
My name is MichaÅ‚ and I am currently a first-year student of Computer Science and intelligent systems at AGH.
I am currently implementing a group project on the subject of IT tools.
### Skills & hobbies ###
- C - beginner

I am friendly and sympathetic towards other people. I like to work in a team and I am an organized person. I am also aware of my strengths and weaknesses.

- :biking_man:	Cycling is one of my hobbies. I ride a bike regularly and I take part in XC / MTB competitions.
- :mountain_snow:	Mountains give me a sense of freedom. That's why I often go skiing, which makes me happy.

A quote that makes things easier for me:
